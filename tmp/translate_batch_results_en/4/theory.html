# Table Data
<p>Rows arenâ€™t sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the <em>table data</em> element: <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code><div><span>&lt;</span><span>table</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>tr</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>td</span><span>&gt;</span>73<span>&lt;/</span><span>td</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>td</span><span>&gt;</span>81<span>&lt;/</span><span>td</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/</span><span>tr</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>table</span><span>&gt;</span></div></code></pre>
<p>In the example above, two data points (<code>73</code> and <code>81</code>) were entered in the one row that exists. By adding two data points, we created two cells of data. </p>
<p>If the table were displayed in the browser, it would show a table with one row and two columns.</p>
