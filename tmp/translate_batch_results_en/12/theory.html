# Styling with CSS
<p>Tables, by default, are very bland. They have no borders, the font color is black, and the typeface is the same type used for other HTML elements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www..com/learn/learn-css" target="_blank">CSS</a>, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page. You can use CSS to style tables. Specifically, you can style the various aspects mentioned above.</p>
<pre><code><div><span>table</span>, <span>th</span>, <span>td</span> {
  <span>border</span>: <span>1px</span> <span>solid</span> <span>black</span>;
  <span>font-family</span>: <span>Arial</span>, <span>sans-serif</span>;
  <span>text-align</span>: <span>center</span>;
}</div></code></pre>
<p>The code in the example above demonstrates just some of the various table aspects you can style using CSS properties. </p>
